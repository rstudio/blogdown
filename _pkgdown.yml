- title: Output formats
  desc: >
    If you use files with the `.Rmd` extension, the default output format is
    `blogdown::html_page`, which uses Pandoc to render. You may also use files with the `.Rmarkdown` file extension, which
    may be knit to `.markdown` files to be processed by Hugo's markdown renderer.
