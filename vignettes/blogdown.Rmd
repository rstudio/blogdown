Written by Yihui Xie, the package author, [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) introduces the R package and how to use it. The book is published by Chapman & Hall/CRC, and you can read it online for free.

The book is structured into 5 parts to guide the reader into the use of the R package **blogdown** to create and manage websites: 

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# run this to update the content below
xfun::pkg_attach2("xml2")
html <- read_html("https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/")
chapters <- xml_find_all(html, "//li[@class='chapter']")
first_level <- chapters[which(purrr::map_lgl(xml_attr(chapters, 'data-level'), ~ grepl('^\\d+$', .x)))]
titles <- xml_text(xml_find_all(first_level, "a"))
titles <- gsub("^(\\d+)", "\\1.", titles)
titles <- gsub("^(.*) \\([*])$", "\\1", titles)
url <- file.path("https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown", xml_attr(first_level, "data-path"))
formatted <- sprintf("* [%s](%s)", titles, url)
cat(formatted, sep = "\n")
```


* [1. Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/get-started.html) introduces the package and how to get started using it. This is the chapter every user is expected to read.
* [2. Hugo](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/hugo.html) introduces [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), the static site generator on which blogdown is based. It will act as a guide to those who are just getting started with Hugo.

* [4. Migration](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/migration.html) explains how to migrate from other framework to a Hugo website.
* [5. Other Generators](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/other-generators.html) explains how to use **blogdown** with a custom build method.


**A note from the authors**: Some of the information and instructions in this book are now out of date because of changes to Hugo and the recent  **blogdown** package. Most of the book is still valid but some chapters may have less accurate informations

## About R Markdown
