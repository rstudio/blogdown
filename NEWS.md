# CHANGES IN blogdown VERSION 0.6 (unreleased)

## NEW FEATURES

- Added a `title_case` argument to the `new_post()` function; if `TRUE`, the post title will be converted to title case. See `?blogdown::new_post` for details.

- Added a `hostname` argument to `install_theme()` and `new_site()`, as a complement to the `theme` argument. The default `hostname` is `'github.com'`; if you have access to GitHub Enterprise, you can use this to specify it instead (thanks, @ijlyttle, #264).

- The `new_post` addin now lets you choose an archetype. See https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/ for more details (thanks, @lcolladotor, #173).

- Added a new RStudio addin (`insert_image`) for inserting external images into blog posts (thanks, @lcolladotor, #269). By default it uses the baseurl so that RSS feeds will include the images and be properly displayed in websites such as RBloggers (#275). You will need to publish the images so that they are displayed in a local preview.

- The `theme` argument of `install_theme()` and `new_site()` now accepts a full URL to a theme's repository zip file. This can be used to install themes from other web-based git hosts, like GitLab and Bitbucket (thanks, @gadenbuie, #271).

## BUG FIXES

- The `kind` argument (i.e., the archetype) of `new_content()` now works with files that end in `.Rmd` and `.Rmarkdown`. The archetype still has to end in `.md` for Hugo to work with it (thanks, @lcolladotor, #261).

# CHANGES IN blogdown VERSION 0.5

## BUG FIXES

- The bug #233 still exists on Windows (thanks, Sheng Luan).

- A warning will be issued if two versions of Hugo are found (thanks, @mingsnu, #235).

- Plots are missing if a post filename contains multibyte characters (thanks, @dongzhuoer, #233).

## MAJOR CHANGES

- The **later** package is a required dependency on Windows for `blogdown::serve_site()` now (#169).

# CHANGES IN blogdown VERSION 0.2

## BUG FIXES

- `serve_site()` failed to parse `baseurl` in config.toml when it contains comments (thanks, @ummel, https://github.com/rbind/support/issues/62).

- Three dashes in the beginning and/or end of config.yaml are ignored (thanks, @andrewheiss, #194).

- The R startup profile `.Rprofile` under the website project root directory should be respected when building R Markdown posts (thanks, @eisioriginal, #222).
