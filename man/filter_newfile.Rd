\description{
Filter files by checking if their modification times or MD5 checksums have
changed.
}
\details{
The function \code{filter_newfile()} returns paths of source files that do
not have corresponding output files, e.g., an \file{.Rmd} file that doesn't
have the \file{.html} output file.

The function \code{timestamp_filer()} compares the modification time of an
Rmd file with that of its output file, and returns the path of a file if it
is newer than its output file by \code{N} seconds (or if the output file does
not exist), where \code{N} is obtained from the R global option
\code{blogdown.time_diff}. By default, \code{N = 0}. You may change it via
\code{options()}, e.g., \code{options(blogdown.time_diff = 5)} means an Rmd
file will be returned when its modification time at least 5 seconds newer
than its output file's modification time.

The function \code{filter_md5sum()} reads the MD5 checksums of files from a
database (a tab-separated text file), and returns the files of which the
checksums have changed. If the database does not exist, write the checksums
of files to it, otherwise update the checksums after the changed files have
been identified. When a file is modified, its MD5 checksum is very likely to
change.

These functions can be used to determine which Rmd files to be rebuilt in a
\pkg{blogdown} website. See \code{\link{build_site}()} for more information.
