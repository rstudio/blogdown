#' The \pkg{blogdown} package
#'
#' The comprehensive documentation of this package is the book \bold{blogdown:
#' Creating Websites with R Markdown}
#' (\url{https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/}). You are expected to read at
#' least the first chapter. If you are really busy or do not care about an
#' introduction to \pkg{blogdown} (e.g., you are very familiar with creating
#' websites), set your working directory to an empty directory, and run
#' \code{blogdown::\link{new_site}()} to get started right away.
